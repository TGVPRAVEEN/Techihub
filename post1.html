<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tech giant's newest trademark application provided insight into the company's plans for its Self-Repair programme, reports SamMobile.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the trademark application, the app's icon consists of a stylised cogwheel and a wrench against a blue background.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The trademark application explained "Self Repair Assistant" as a "computer application software for mobile phones for self-installation and self-maintenance of smartwatches, tablets, mobile phones, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/earbuds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earbuds</a>."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is expected to provide "consultancy and information services relating to self-installation and self-repair" of various mobile device types.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It will help users by telling them how they should manage and repair their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-samsung" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samsung</a>&nbsp;mobile devices.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The company introduced its similar Self-Repair programme in the US in August.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By then, the programme was only accessible to a few Galaxy devices, so the new application is likely to expand on that list.</p>
