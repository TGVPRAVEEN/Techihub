<p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google</a>&nbsp;has announced new updates for Workspace that include resizable pivot tables in Sheets, improved search results in Gmail, and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Sheets, users will be able to resize the pivot table editor side panel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This feature is particularly useful when the names of columns or fields are too long and the user wants to see the entire text, according to the blogpost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, the company said that it will use users' recent Gmail search activity to improve search results when they access the email service via the web.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This enhancement to Gmail search will make results more relevant and contextual, said the blogpost.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the tech giant announced the ability to join or present to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google</a>&nbsp;Meet call from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google</a>&nbsp;Docs, Sheets or Slides.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the new update, if users are presenting or joining a meeting from a file, they can easily share that file with meeting attendees through an in-meeting chat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this, they will be able to grant access to a document, spreadsheet, or presentation to all or select meeting attendees, allowing everyone in the meeting to collaborate while having a conversation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The updates will be available to all Workspace and G Suite users within the next 15 business days, the blogpost added.</p>
